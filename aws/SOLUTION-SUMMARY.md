# Maps Bridge AWS Infrastructure Solution Summary

## Requirements Addressed

The updated CloudFormation template (`cloudformation-template-updated.yaml`) addresses all the requirements specified in
the issue:

1. ✅ **EC2 Instance Creation**
    - Created a t2.micro EC2 instance (smallest free tier eligible instance)
    - Configured with Amazon Linux 2023 AMI
    - Installed Docker for container deployment
    - Configured with public IP for accessibility

2. ✅ **PostgreSQL Database Creation**
    - Created a db.t3.micro RDS instance (free tier eligible)
    - Deployed in private subnets for security
    - Configured with minimal storage (20GB)
    - Set up with proper security groups

3. ✅ **EC2 to Database Connection**
    - Configured security groups to allow EC2 to connect to RDS
    - Placed RDS in private subnets accessible from EC2
    - EC2 and RDS in the same VPC for secure communication

4. ✅ **GitHub CI/CD Access**
    - Configured EC2 with SSH access (port 22)
    - Maintained compatibility with existing GitHub Actions workflow
    - Documented required GitHub secrets for deployment

5. ✅ **CloudWatch Configuration**
    - Maintained existing CloudWatch dashboard and metrics
    - Added EC2 and RDS metrics to the dashboard
    - Configured CloudWatch agent on EC2 for system and container logs
    - Set up log groups and metric filters for application logs

6. ✅ **Logs/Metrics Pushing**
    - Configured IAM role and instance profile for EC2 to access CloudWatch
    - Set up CloudWatch agent to collect and push logs and metrics
    - Added alarms for critical conditions

7. ✅ **Public Port Access**
    - Configured security group to allow public access to port 8080
    - Ensured EC2 instance has a public IP address
    - Set up proper routing through Internet Gateway

8. ✅ **Domain Configuration**
    - Configured mapsbridge.com domain to point to the application
    - Set up SSL certificate for secure HTTPS access
    - Created DNS records for both apex domain and www subdomain
    - Configured Application Load Balancer for domain routing

## Best Practices Implemented

1. **Security**
    - Principle of least privilege for IAM roles
    - Database in private subnets
    - Security groups with minimal required access
    - Secure parameter handling with NoEcho

2. **High Availability**
    - Resources distributed across multiple Availability Zones
    - Proper subnet configuration for resilience

3. **Monitoring and Alerting**
    - Comprehensive CloudWatch dashboard
    - Alarms for critical conditions
    - Email notifications for alerts

4. **Cost Optimization**
    - Free tier eligible resources
    - Minimal storage allocations
    - Right-sized instances for the application

5. **Maintainability**
    - Well-structured template with logical organization
    - Descriptive resource names and tags
    - Comprehensive documentation

## Files Created/Modified

1. `/aws/cloudformation-template-updated.yaml` - The updated CloudFormation template with all required resources
2. `/aws/README-infrastructure.md` - Comprehensive documentation for the infrastructure
3. `/aws/SOLUTION-SUMMARY.md` - This summary of the solution

## Deployment Instructions

Detailed deployment instructions are provided in the `README-infrastructure.md` file, including:

1. Prerequisites
2. Parameter configuration
3. Stack deployment commands
4. GitHub CI/CD integration
5. Monitoring and maintenance

## Future Considerations

1. **Auto Scaling** - For production environments, consider implementing Auto Scaling for the EC2 instances
2. **Multi-AZ RDS** - For higher availability, enable Multi-AZ deployment for RDS
3. **Backup Strategy** - Implement a comprehensive backup strategy for the database
4. **Secret Management** - Consider using AWS Secrets Manager for database credentials
5. **Infrastructure as Code Pipeline** - Set up a CI/CD pipeline for infrastructure changes
